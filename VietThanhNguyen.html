    <h4>I borrowed this book from someone's house I didn't know...so I couldn't dogear it or make any markings and it was full of so much beautiful writing I gave up trying to keep track of it all.
    The few I managed to write down somewhere while I was reading it. </h4>
    <p>We don’t succeed or fail because of fortune or luck. We succeed because we understand the way the world works and what we have to do. We fail because others understand this better than we do. </p>
    <p>The unseen is always underlined by the unsaid. </p>
    <p>Remember, you're not half of anything, you're twice of everything.</p>
    <p>
      We’re revolutionaries, my friend. Suffering made us. Suffering for the people is what we chose because we sympathized so much with their suffering.
      Around our shoulders and chest we will strap the rucksack, cipher and manuscript inside. Whether we live or die, the weight of those words will hang on us. What do those who struggle against power do when they seize power? What does the revolutionary do when the revolution triumphs? Why do those who call for independence and freedom take away the independence and freedom of others? And is it sane or insane to believe, as so many around us apparently do, in nothing? Our life and our death has taught us always to sympathize with the undesirables among the undesirables. Thus magnetized by experience, our compass continually pointing toward those who suffer. </p>
