<p class= "title">Thanks for telling me who my close friends are, Instagram</p>

<p>
I’ve never posted an Instagram story. [Upon finishing this post this is no longer true but to keep the structure of this post when I first wrote it, it’s staying.]
The fact that I haven’t experienced the evolution of the story platform and updates has made me scared to attempt to understand all the functionality it holds.
Polling, moving images, stickers, fancy animations – I am inept. I wasn't a consumer of stories either until Instagram changed that in a genius and subtle way. </p>
<p>I can’t remember when it happened. I was minding my own business on Instagram vertically scrolling  when I noticed the green rim around some of the stories. That’s new.</p>

<p>One click on a story lead me to the glorious tiny words in caps “CLOSE FRIENDS.” This person identifies me as a close friend? What a monumental milestone that
was never acknowledge or celebrated! Or wait, maybe there was just never an optimal feature that could illustrate this type of relationship? One comparison
that comes to mind is the glorious and ego-boosting MySpace Top 8 Friends, which later on added on the ability to expand from 8 to 10, 12, 16, etc.
A digital showcase of your friendships ranked for your community to see. Eventually when Facebook took over the market share for social networking, the feature
of top 8 was lost forever, until now with Instagram’s feature. </p>

<p>Except it’s different, in a brilliant way. It’s not a proclamation for the world to see. It’s not supposed to be. The green rim is an indicator to you alone
  that you have been invited into the exclusive moments in someone’s life. You’re invited to the private self that someone wants you to see. And that
  type of invitation while not public information, makes it a public act in itself that transfers into the real world.</p>

<p>While hanging out with a group of people, I asked them what makes them choose to post something to close friends versus general.
  All the responses basically fell under the same concept: <strong>they post to close friends when the content doesn’t align with how they
    want the public world to perceive them, but their close friends are those who truly know who they are – the public and private self.</strong></p>

    <p>I sincerely feel a sense of moral obligation when I see that green rim to click on it. I'm impressed that Instagram has added a functionality that
    makes me feel this way. Instagram +1, The amount of time gone by watching stories -227 seconds </p>
