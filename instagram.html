<h2>Thanks for telling me who my close friends are, Instagram</h2>
<p>
I’ve never posted an Instagram story. [Upon finishing this post my friends did art direct my story one night so this into isn’t true anymore but to keep the integral structure of this article of when I first wrote it, it’s staying.] The fact that I haven’t experienced the evolution of the story platform and updates has made me scared to even attempt to understand all the functionality it holds. Polling, moving images, stickers, fancy animations – I am inept. I was also never an avid watcher, but Instagram changed that in a genius and subtle way. I can’t even remember when it happened. I was minding my own business on Instagram, going about the old school vertical scroll down when I noticed the green rim around some of the stories. That’s new.
<br>
<br>
One click on a story lead me to the glorious tiny words in caps “CLOSE FRIENDS.” This person identifies me as a close friend? What a monumental milestone that was never acknowledge or celebrated! Or wait, maybe there was just never an optimal feature that could illustrate this type of relationship? One comparison that comes to mind is the glorious and ego-boosting MySpace Top 8 Friends, which later on added on the ability to expand from 8 to 10, 12, 16, etc. A digital showcase of your friendships ranked for your community to see. Eventually when Facebook took over the market share for social networking, the feature of top 8 was lost forever, until now with Instagram’s feature.
<br>
<br>
Except it’s different, in a brilliant way. It’s not a proclamation for the world to see. It’s not supposed to be. The green rim is an indicator to you alone that you have been invited into the exclusive moments in someone’s life. You’re invited to the private self that someone wants you to see. And that type of invitation while not public information, makes it a public act in itself that transfers into the real world.
<br>
<br>
I was recently hanging out with a group of people and I asked them what makes them choose to post something to close friends versus general. All the responses basically fell under the same concept: <strong>they post to close friends when the content doesn’t align with how they want the public world to perceive them, but their close friends are those who truly know who they are – the public and private self.</strong>
<br>
<br>
Instagram has given us a way to disclose a customized group of friends to see exclusive content, and I think it’s the most brilliant addition. It’s even more brilliant because you could just add all your followers to your close friends, and give everyone that feeling of feeling special and important? But people probably don’t do that. Why? Because it’s not the same as MySpace’s top 108 friends. People truly use this functionality for the intended purpose and along the way, gives validation to people who never knew they were in the inner circle in the first place.
