<h3> – Haruki Murakami</h3>
<h4> This is the first book Murakami ever wrote. He has a short intro about how he decided to become a novelist and he shares the most normalized preomonition about his life. If you don't ever read this book, I recommend you at least read that short intro.</h4>
<p>Lies are terrible things. One could say that the greatest sins afflicting modern society are the proliferation of lies and silence. We lie through our teeth, then swallow our tongues. All the same, were we to speak only the truth all year round, then the truth might lose its value.
pg. 34 </p>

Now I think it’s time to tell my story. Which doesn’t mean, of course, that I have resolved even one of my problems, or that I will be somehow different when I finish. I may not have changed at all. In the end, writing is not a full step toward self-healing, just a tiny, very tentative move in that direction. All the same, writing honestly is very difficult. The more I try to be honest, the farther my words sink into darkness.
pg. 4</p>
<p>
I find the act of writing very painful. I can go a whole month without managing a single line, or write three days and nights straight, only to find the whole thing has missed the mark. At the same time, though, I love writing. Ascribing meaning to life is a piece of cake compared to actually living it.
pg 7</p>

It had been a long time since I felt the fragrance of summer: the scent of the ocean, a distant train whistle, the touch of a girl’s skin, the lemony perfume of her hair, the evening wind, faint glimmers of hope, summer dreams. But none of these were the way they once had been; they were all somehow off, as if copied with tracing paper that kept slipping out of place.
pg 89</p>

<p>
Her silence lasted a long time. A very long time. I lay there in a half-concious state, gazing at the dark ceiling.
pg 92</p>

<p>
All things pass. None of us can manage to hold on to anything. In that way, we live our lives.</p>

***** New Yorker interview w/ Murakami
You said in a Paris Review interview a few years ago that the driving force of your stories was “missing and searching and finding.” Do you think that’s still true?
Yes. That is a very big theme of my fiction—missing something and seeking it and finding it. My characters are often looking for something that has been lost. Sometimes it’s a girl, sometimes it’s a cause, sometimes it’s a purpose. But they are looking for something important, something critical, that was lost. But when the character finds it, there will be some kind of disappointment. I don’t know why, but that is a kind of motif in my fiction—looking for something and finding it, but it’s not a happy ending.</p>
