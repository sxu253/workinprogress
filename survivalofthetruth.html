<p class= "title">Survival of the Truh</p>

<p> I used to be vehement about pouring my energy into everything I did. I had grandeur ideas about myself, I was all over the place. In college I wrote, I took photos, I designed things, I went to class and tried to memorize Bayes’ theorem. In truth, I was trying with all my might to be impressive. Super impressive. I was doing a lot but going in so many different directions I felt like I always ended up in the same spot. I cringe thinking about the amount of time I spent doing random things with absolutely no direction. Only later did I eventually recognize some traits that stood out from the rest; however, I should have figured it out in a shorter amount of time, which could have been allocated to improving said traits. If I had just been honest with myself and not been blinded by my desire to be validated. *cue pity music*
</p>

<p>
At least I can recognize this behavior pretty clearly in myself now. When I’m in situations where people are trying to be impressive, my internal dialogue immediately recognizes this pissing contest and tries to navigate the conversation with dexterity and an exit strategy.
</p>

<p>
I’m still learning how to present myself without having any inkling of being perceived as pretentious. We’ve all had those conversations with some people who we find out much later that they are super impressive, but upon initial interaction are able to create a lovely dialogue without ever bringing up those crazy details. Whenever I find myself meeting these kinds of people, I meticulously watch. I observe. I look at their body language, their eye contact, how they bring the conversation back to the other person, the words they choose. I feel like a detective, except I know who did it and now I’m piecing together how they did it. How are they able to bring themselves into a conversation without ego? It’s so hard to do. I’m sure there’s an evolutionary explanation for why we do this, to attract the opposite sex, threaten predators, etc. but those primal instincts aren’t required in most social interactions to survive today, at least not the ones I partake in. Maybe what I’m talking about isn’t survival of the fittest, it’s survival of the truth. Your truth. My truth. The truth that maybe we find more value in our monetary gain than our personal gains. That we prioritize the number and hold it sacred in our hearts and extol pseudo-virtues of passion, honesty, and diversity to cover up that maybe our truth can be bought. That maybe we’ve invested so much time in other things that when we take those things away, we don’t know what will be left.
