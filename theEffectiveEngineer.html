    <h4>I copied down all the gems from the book. Not a necessary a book you need to read through all the way, all the words I've collected here are what I found the most interesting/useful.
    Some of this is copied word for word, some of it is my own infused thoughts/paraphrasing.</h4>
    <p> Instead of asking first : How should we do this?  <strong>ask —> Why do we need to do this at all?</strong></p>
    <p>To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact. 2</p>
    <p><strong>leverage = impact produced / time invested</strong></p>
    <p>high-leverage activities behave similarly, letting you amplify your limited time and effort to produce much more impact. 12</p>
    <h4>Only 3 ways to increase leverage:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>reduce time it takes to complete activity —> how can i complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?</li>
      <li>increase output of activity —> how can i increase the value produced by this activity?</li>
      <li>shifting a higher-leverage activity —> is there something else I could spend my time on that would produce more value?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    *don’t confused high-leverage activities with easy wins*
    </p>
    <h4>Optimize for learning!!</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more knowledge even faster.</li>
    <li>The earlier you optimize for learning, the more time your learning has to compound.</li>
    <li>Due to compounding, even small deltas in your own learning rate make a big difference over the long run.</li>
    </ul>
