    <p>How to learn to code: 5 easy steps – 2:30 mins</p>
    <p>How to learn to code (quickly and easily!) – 11 mins</p>
    <p>How to learn programming and get confidence in it – 8 mins</p>
    <p>It’s getting increasingly easier to access information. I came across these videos about programming and it made me remember when I tried teaching myself how to program…it was pitiful. I started many times, and stopped the same amount. Each time I started again, it was due to some catalyst that filled me with motivation that never lasted. It never got me through the hardships. I took the easier option of learning. I wanted to learn how to program in 5 easy steps. I wanted to learn to code quickly and even better, easily!</p>
    <p>Discipline and a strong will to continue while in the unknown are likely indicators of whether someone can self-teach. The dissemination of information is beneficial for those who can build on existing knowledge or have a specific subject matter in mind. For those just starting – it’s daunting, and with the wrong mindset, leads to quick endings because you’ll never get over the inevitable hardships. I took my first programming course because I needed to commit, and I knew at the time, I wouldn’t be able to do it on my own. Structured learning allowed me to challenge myself to be more discipline, to be more resilient with the unknown. It’s still easy (and at times more appealing) to take shortcuts – copying portions of code you googled, reusing code without understanding it fully, etc.</p>
    <p>But it’s done with the understanding that nothing sustainable comes from a quick fix. No 10 easy steps to living a better life, 5 tips from successful CEO’s, or 3 ways to be a morning person is going to bring you to the result you desire. There’s no hidden gems in those articles – I swear, I’ve read them all. Investing time and energy in the fundamentals has always been the path.</p>
    <p>Sometimes along the path I get distracted by quick fixes that promise an “easier” alternative, take it from someone who is naturally curious – don’t detour. Stay the course, the end destination just might surprise you.</p>
