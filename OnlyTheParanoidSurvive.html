<p class= "title">Only the Paranoid Survive </p>
<h3> â€“ Andrew S. Grove</h3>
<h4>This book chronicles the history of how Intel navigated the tumultuous technology landscape through the lens of the CEO Andrew Grove.
  Written in 1994, Grove predicated a shocking amount of technology advancements that have come true in the marketplace today. This book
is basically worth a year of business school. Not joking. I even used what I learned in this book on the GRE. Also not joking. </h4>


<p> An inflection point occurs where the old strategic picture dissolves and gives way to the new, allowing the business
to ascend to new heights. However, if you don't navigate your way through an inflection point, you go through a peak and after
the peak the business declines. It is around such inflection points that managers puzzle and observe, "Things are different.
Something has changed." Put another way, a strategic inflection point is when the balance of forces shifts from the old structure,
from the old ways of doing business and the old ways of competing, to the new. 33 </p>

<p>Of course you can't spend all of your time listening to random inputs. But you should be open to them. As you keep doing it, you will
develop a feel for whose views are apt to contain gems of information and a sense of who will take advantage of your openess to clutter
you with noise. Over time, you can adjust your receptivity accordingly. 110</p>

<p>Debates are like the process through which a photographer sharpens the contrast when developing a print. The clearer images that result permit
management to make a more informed and more likely correct call. The point is, strategic inflection points are rarely clear. Well-informed and
well-intentioned poeple will look at the same picture and assign dramatically different interpretations to it. So it is extraordinarily important
to bring the intellectual power of all relevant parties to this sharpening process. 116</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding frivolous, you have to know when to hold your data and when to fold 'em. You have to know when to argue with data.
  Yet you have to be able to argue with the data when your experience and judgement suggest the emergence of a force that may be too small to
 show up in the analysis but has the potential to grow so big as to change the rules your business operates by. The point is, when dealing with
emerging trends, you may very well have to go against rational extrapolation of data and rely instead on anecdotal observations and your instincts. 117 </p>
</p>

<p>We at Intel have worked hard to break down the walls between those who possess knowledge power and those who possess organizational power...
One is not better than the other in managing strategic change...Ideally, each will respect the other for what he/she brings to the party and will not be
intimidated by the other's knowledge or power. An environment like this is easy to describe but hard to create and maintain. Dramatic or symbolic moves
do nothings. It requires living this culture, promoting constant collaborative exchanges between the holders of knowledge pwer and the holders of
organizational power to create the best solutions in the interest of both. 120 </p>
