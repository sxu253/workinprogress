<p> I interviewed for a front-end developer position at a local radio company months ago. I had dabbled in HTML and CSS, not enough to create a project right then and there, but I applied anyway. Got an interview, and thought, “shit, I need to dig deeper into this language.” At the time, I was studying Java and had taken a course in Python. This was my first interview that required technical knowledge that wasn’t business/visual design related. </p>

<p> I spent a few hours studying the front-end languages. I was optimistic. The job description stated basic working knowledge of html/css. I felt good afterwards. I felt like I was giving off good communication vibes. I didn’t get the offer. I remember receiving the e-mail and rethinking every part of the interview and all of a sudden all those moments I thought I was excelling, I now saw them in a new light. Maybe my confidence was misinterpreted as arrogance? Maybe my willingness to answer boldly was perceived as pretentious? Maybe my hopes of coming across as proactive came off as desperate? I thought all these thoughts and then thought, “none of this matters. you'll never know what's going on, on the other side. you can't go through life just making up assumptions. i know from being on the other side of the table, there are a vast amount of variables that go into deciding who to pick. many of which that don't concern the actual candidate. it's a waste of life. at least you learned some html/css. move on."
</p>
<p>
...and I did.
</p>
<p>
Last week I reached out to a designer at work, and asked if there were any projects I could take on for my last week at this project management internship. He asked if I knew any html/css, I smiled and said, yes.  </p>
