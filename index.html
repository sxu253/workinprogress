<p>These days I spend my time running, reading, programming, writing, thinking about musubis, trying to catch up on HunterXHunter,
  learning new programming languages, playing badminton, memorizing big-O runtimes for search algorithms, some photography, planning the great American roadtrip
  with raph and ben, working on this website, and doing homework. </p>

<p>I wanted to make a website that served as a playground for me to mess around with front-end and learn without
  the pressure of making it a perfect website. I also wanted a website where I could collect my thoughts on Computer Science,
  stuff I find cool about it, stuff I find not so cool, thoughts about certain products and features, musings about
  my experience being a person, etc. You'll figure it out. Or maybe you won't. Who knows? You might learn something new today.
  And isn't that the point? </p>

<div style = "width: 100px; color: black" > </div>
<p>currently reading: </p>
              <ul>The Effective Engineer by Edmond Lao </ul>
              <ul>A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami</ul>
              <ul>Fascism by Madeleine Albright</ul>
<p> If you ever get annoyed when you borrow a book from a friend and it's dog-eared to the max [only if it's a good book],
  and various sentences are underlined in pen, you might not want to borrow any of my books. Sentences that make me
  stop and think are sentences I don't like forgetting. So I try to transcribe them in various places so I don't.
The books section in the control center serves as my public archive, mostly so I can access them even when I'm away
from my devices. I guess in a way it could also serve as your tl;dr version of the book, or maybe it'll prompt you to want to read it.
Which I would consider to be the greatest win of all. </p>
