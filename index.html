<p>These days I spend my time running, reading, programming, writing, learning C, thinking about musubis, trying to catch up on HunterXHunter,
  playing badminton, trying to prove runtime theorems, some photography, and thinking of what else to add to this website. </p>

<p>I wanted to make a website that served as a playground for me to mess around with front-end and learn without
  the pressure of making it a perfect website. I also wanted a website where I could collect my thoughts on Computer Science,
  stuff I find cool about it, stuff I find not so cool, thoughts about certain products and features, musings about
  my experience being a person, etc. You'll figure it out. Or maybe you won't. Who knows? You might learn something new today.
  And isn't that the point? </p>


<p>currently reading: </p>
              <ul>21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari</ul>
              <ul>A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami</ul>
              <ul>Fascism by Madeleine Albright</ul>
<p> If you ever get annoyed when you borrow a book from a friend and it's dog-eared to the max [only if it's a good book],
  and various sentences are underlined in pen, you might not want to borrow any of my books. Sentences that make me
  stop and think are sentences I don't like forgetting. So I try to transcribe them in various places so I don't.
The books section in the control center serves as my public archive, mostly so I can access them even when I'm away
from my devices. I guess in a way it could also serve as your tl;dr version of the book, or maybe it'll prompt you to want to read it.
Which I would consider to be the greatest win of all. </p>
