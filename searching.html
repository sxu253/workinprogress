<p class= "title">Is this what you're searching for?</p>

<p>Upon learning a multitude of search algorithms this quarter, I have endured an immense amount of terrible tutorials and graphics attempting to illustrate step-by-step movements.
It reminds me of when I went to a data visualization talk where the speaker was both a data scientist and a designer, and he talked
about the idea of what "beauty" means to different people. The auditorium was filled with people from
the science world, design world or just generally interested in data visualization. The speaker showed an image of what's supposedly the
most beautiful algorithm in the whole world, from what I remember it represents the meaning of life or something similar to that.</p>

<p>When this image flashed on the screen, 3 different reactions happened simultaneously:</p>
<p>1. Applause</p>
<p>2. Groaning</p>
<p>3. Laughter</p>

<p>People who applauded were the scientists. People who groaned were the designers because the algorithm was written
in Comic Sans. And the people who were laughing, either understood both reactions, or just had no idea what was going on.</p>

<p><strong>In one image, this speaker demonstrated how knowledge transforms what we perceive to be beautiful or ugly in this world.</strong>
Coming from a scrappy visual background and going into Computer Science is interesting because I'm learning to value a
different kind of beauty. I'm understanding now why some algorithms can be described as "elegant" and the value in writing
"clean code." I'm learning to search for the beauty in things that I find visually unappealing, even if it means enduring Comic Sans
and unecessary dropshadows for the time being.</p>
